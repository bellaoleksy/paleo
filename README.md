## Welcome! :wave: 
This is a public repository for the code needed to recreate the analysis in [Oleksy et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.0304): "Nutrients and warming interact to force mountain lakes into unprecedented ecological states."

Adding a test line here.

## Instructions for use
* You should be able to run all the analyses from `01_GAMS_and_plots.Rmd`, which pulls in data that has been cleaned up from their raw format in `00_data_input_and_manipulation.Rmd`.

## Data availability
The data used in this analysis is available through USGS

> Oleksy, I., Baron, J.S., Leavitt, P., Spaulding, S.A., 2019, Paleoecological data from The Loch and Sky Pond, Rocky Mountain National Park: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9MVU3CX.

## Objectives 
Using algal and biogeochemical proxies from lake sediment cores, we examined patterns in biogeochemistry (elemental composition, stable isotopes), lake primary production, and composition of primary producers (pigments of algae and cyanobacteria, diatom subfossils) from the end of the Little Ice Age ca 1850 to present in an alpine lake, Sky Pond, and a subalpine lake, The Loch. Sky Pond was cored previously to explore changes in diatom and N isotope proxies caused by atmospheric N deposition. Additional proxies, described below, build on earlier work and address changes since the initial core in 1997. The Loch had not previously been cored, but information gained by the addition of this second proximal lake was anticipated to either further support conclusions if results for the two lakes were similar, or provide data to determine why they may differ. In particular, we were interested in whether contemporary assemblages of primary producers differ from those in the past, if similar changes occurred in two lakes located in the same watershed, and whether changes were synchronous with other major shifts in the Earth System since 1950. The period around 1950 has been suggested as the start date for the Anthropocene and the beginning of rapid environmental and socio-economic changes have been termed the Great Acceleration.
